## Rules

- [Coding](../core/rules/coding.md)
- [Architecture](../core/rules/architecture.md)
- [Testing](../core/rules/testing.md)
- [Git](../core/rules/git.md)
- [Documentation](../core/rules/docs.md)
- [Security](../core/rules/security.md)

## Skills

- [Context](../core/skills/context.md) — discover current reality; read-only
- [Specify](../core/skills/specify.md) — define WHAT and WHY
- [Plan](../core/skills/plan.md) — define HOW
- [Tasks](../core/skills/tasks.md) — create an executable breakdown
- [Implement](../core/skills/implement.md) — execute the approved scope
- [Verify](../core/skills/verify.md) — produce evidence against success criteria
- [Converge](../core/skills/converge.md) — compare outcomes and evidence, then route remaining gaps

## Workflows

- [Feature](../core/workflows/feature.md) — new capabilities or intentional behavior changes
- [Bugfix](../core/workflows/bugfix.md) — defects with reproduction or assessment, diagnosis, correction, and regression verification
- [Refactor](../core/workflows/refactor.md) — structural change with baseline and behavioral preservation

## Enforcement and onboarding

- Use the [gate contract and runner](../gates/CONTRACT.md) for the implemented read-only deterministic checks.
- Follow the [verification and evidence contract](verification-evidence.md) when reporting results.
- Use [project onboarding](onboarding.md) to inspect a target and create a missing project-context file without replacing existing work.

## Distribution and installation

- Use the [installer](../installer/install.ps1) to preview and install AI Dev System into new and existing projects.
- Use the [updater](../installer/update.ps1) to safely apply versioned updates while preserving project context and custom instructions.

See the [README](../README.md) for scope and intended lifecycle, [VERSION](../VERSION) for the release version, and [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) for recorded changes. Add routes as real documentation or implementations become available.
